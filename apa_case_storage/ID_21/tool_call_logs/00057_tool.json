    "result": "I have defined and implemented the full workflow as requested. It triggers manually, reads data from the specified Google Sheet, uses AI completion to classify each commercial entry's Description as 'to Business' or 'to Customer', then sends the 'to Business' entries to Slack #general channel with properly formatted messages and sends the 'to Customer' entries via Gmail to the specified email address with appropriate subject and message content. All actions have been tested with example data and the workflow handles empty data gracefully. The Slack messages use Blocks UI with fallback text to avoid errors, and Gmail messages are sent with text email type. The workflow is ready for deployment and use. Please provide any feedback or further requests."
