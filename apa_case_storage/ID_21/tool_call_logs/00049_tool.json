However, the Gmail sending in Step 6 is done inline instead of using the implemented action_3, which may cause inconsistency. Also, the Slack sending uses action_2 which is currently set to send a fixed test message, not dynamic messages. To finalize, I will update the Slack action_2 parameters to use dynamic 'text' from input data and modify mainWorkflow to use action_3 for Gmail sending for consistency and clarity.",
