The current code uses 'messageType'='block' with 'blocksUi' param, but error persists. Possibly the 'blocksUi' param value is not correctly formatted as a stringified JSON. We should fix the 'blocksUi' param to be a JSON string with properly escaped quotes and the expression inside string. Also, ensure 'text' param is a plain string for fallback.",
