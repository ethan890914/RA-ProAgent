    "result": "I have defined and implemented the manual trigger, Google Sheets read action, AI classification action, and Slack send message action. The mainWorkflow connects these actions as per the user request: on manual trigger, it reads news headlines from the specified Google Sheet, classifies each headline using AI as technology or sport, and sends the categorized news messages to the Slack channel #news. All functions have been tested with pinned data and work correctly. The workflow handles empty data gracefully and sends messages indexed starting from 1. The task is complete and ready for user feedback."
