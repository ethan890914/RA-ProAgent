The workflow triggers manually, searches the folder 'ProAgentWorkspace', finds the file '00005_code.txt', downloads and decodes its content, then sends the content to Slack channel #general with the specified message format. I have tested each step and ensured parameters and data flow are correct. The workflow is ready for user testing and deployment."
