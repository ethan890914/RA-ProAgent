It triggers manually, reads commercial data from the specified Google Sheet, calculates profit for each entry, classifies each description as 'to Business' or 'to Customer' using AI completion, and sends formatted messages to the Slack #general channel. The Slack messages include the index, description, profit, and category. The workflow has been tested and messages are successfully posted to Slack. Please review and provide any feedback or additional requirements."
