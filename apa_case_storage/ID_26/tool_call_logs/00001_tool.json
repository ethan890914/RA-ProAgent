For the googleDrive fileFolder search action, we need to set the params to search files inside the folder named 'ProAgentWorkspace'. However, since we don't have a folder search operation, we must search the folder by name using the fileFolder search and then use the folder ID to search files inside it. For Slack message sending, we need to set the channel to #general and format the message text correctly.",
