This is inconsistent with the previous approach where we use defined action functions. To improve code consistency and maintainability, I will implement a new action function for searching files in a folder by query, and then use it inside the mainWorkflow. This will also allow better testing and parameter control.",

  "criticism": "The main weakness is adding a new action function increases complexity slightly, but it improves clarity and testing. Also, the folder search and file search are two separate steps that must be handled carefully.",
