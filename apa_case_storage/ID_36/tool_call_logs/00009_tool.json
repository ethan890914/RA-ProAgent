  "thought": "The error indicates that the transparent_action's run method only accepts two arguments: input_data and params. However, the current action_1 and action_2 functions are defined to accept two arguments, but when calling function.run(), only input_data and params are passed. The error 'takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given' comes from the fact that action_1 and action_2 are called with two arguments, but the function.run() inside only accepts two. This means the action_1 and action_2 function definitions should accept only one argument (input_data), and the params should be defined inside the function before calling function.run(). To fix this, I will revert action_1 and action_2 to accept only input_data, and pass params inside the function as before. Then, in mainWorkflow, I will call action_1 and action_2 with only input_data, not params.",

  "criticism": "Previously, action_1 and action_2 were modified to accept params as argument, but this caused errors because the underlying function.run() only accepts input_data and params. The extra argument caused TypeError. The correct approach is to keep action functions with one input_data argument and define params inside the function.",
