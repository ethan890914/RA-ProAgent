  "thought": "The current mainWorkflow calls action_1 and action_2 without passing the prepared params (pg_params and slack_params). This might cause the actions to use default or empty params, which could lead to issues. Since we have prepared the params, we should pass them explicitly when calling these actions. Also, from the last execution logs, the workflow seems to have executed successfully, but it's better to explicitly pass params for clarity and correctness.",
  "plan": [
    "Modify mainWorkflow to pass pg_params to action_1 call",
    "Modify mainWorkflow to pass slack_params to action_2 call",

    "Test the workflow to confirm correct execution and output"
  ],
  "criticism": "Currently, the params variables are prepared but not used in the action calls. This can cause unexpected behavior or errors if the actions depend on these params. Explicitly passing params is necessary for reliable execution.",
