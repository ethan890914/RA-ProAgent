This likely causes the folder not to be found because the folder name search expects a single folder name, not a path. To fix this, I will change action_0's params to use 'searchMethod'='query' and provide a query string that searches for a folder named '2025-11-11' with mimeType folder and not trashed, which is the actual folder name we want to find.",
