Instead, the workflow should use the already defined action functions like action_0, action_1, etc. for the folder search and other steps. I will modify the mainWorkflow to call action_0 for folder search instead of creating a new transparent_action instance. This aligns with the pattern used for other actions.",

Also, the folder name used in action_0's params is currently a path string, which may not work well for name-based search. It may require further refinement.",
