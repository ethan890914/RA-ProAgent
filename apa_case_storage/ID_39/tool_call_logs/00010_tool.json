  "thought": "The PostgreSQL action (action_1) is failing because the params dictionary is empty, which causes the workflow to have issues and cannot execute. The input_data has the query string correctly, but params must also have the 'query' string as a plain string and 'options' as an empty dictionary. The current action_1 function does not set params correctly, causing execution failure. I will fix action_1 to extract the query string from input_data and set params accordingly with a plain string for 'query' and empty dict for 'options'.",
