The current 'messages' parameter is passed as a string with '=' prefix, which is wrong. We need to pass the 'messages' parameter as a proper JSON list, not as a string expression. Also, aiCompletion expects input_data to contain the 'messages' field, not in params. So we should pass the 'messages' in input_data and leave params empty. I will rewrite action_0 to pass input_data with the messages and empty params.",
